	    		<p>Hans has flown almost everything there is to fly. He first took the controls of a small plane at 12 years old, and flew solo when he was 14. After a few years flying "anything, anywhere" he settled into a series of test pilot jobs, but left that because he prefers company when he's in the air.</p>
	    		<p>Hans doesn't actually own his own plane right now, unless you count the microlight, but you will find him in the pilot's seat of any of our aircrafts, when he's not skiing, tramping, climbing, hang gliding, or performng with his backup band at the local hotel</p>
